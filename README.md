pi_cubed's Jokers is a lightweight mod with no lovely patching and minimal hooks. As a result, there should be minimal crashes due to conflicts with other mods.

## Config Options
A game restart is required for Config options to take effect.

### New Spectral Cards  
As of writing, this option simply enables or disables Commander from appearing. In future, this will also affect any additional Spectral cards I plan to add.

### Preorder Bonus' Hook  
Turn this option off to rework the Joker's mechanics very slightly to remove its hook that I (very jankily) implemented. This option may be useful if you're experiencing conflicts regarding setting the cost of Booster Packs. A run restart is also required if you have this Joker.

### Custom Sound Effects  
Enables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker and Explosher.
