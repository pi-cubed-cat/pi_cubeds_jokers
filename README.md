pi_cubed's Jokers is a relatively lightweight mod with minimal lovely patching and hooks. As a result, there should be few crashes due to conflicts with other mods.

## Config Options
A game restart is required for Config options to take effect.

### New Spectral Cards  
This option enables or disables the Spectral Cards Commander, Rupture, and Extinction from appearing.

### Custom Sound Effects  
Enables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker, Explosher, On-beat, Off-beat, Pot, Talking Flower, and Monkey See, Monkey Do.

### Hand type-affecting Jokers
Enables or disables any Jokers that directly change your hand and what poker hands it contains. Certain mods that tinker with poker hands can cause crashes or game closures when these Jokers activate. This option is automatically disabled if Paperback is installed. Currently, this affects Mount Joker, Wee Mini, and Round-a-bout.

### Cryptid by MathIsFun_ & many more  
There's some hidden content that requires Cryptid. In addition, I've put a big focus on making sure the changing value mechanics and Misprintize behave properly with all Jokers!
