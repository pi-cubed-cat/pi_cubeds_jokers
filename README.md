pi_cubed's Jokers is a lightweight mod with minimal lovely patching and hooks. As a result, there should be few crashes due to conflicts with other mods.

### Cryptid by MathIsFun_ & many more  
There's some hidden content that requires Cryptid. In addition, I've put a big focus on making sure the changing value mechanics and Misprintize behave properly with all Jokers!

## Config Options
A game restart is required for Config options to take effect.

### New Spectral Cards  
This option enables or disables the Spectral Cards Commander, Rupture, and Extinction from appearing.

### Preorder Bonus' Hook  
Turn this option off to rework the Joker's mechanics very slightly to remove its hook that I (very jankily) implemented. This option may be useful if you're experiencing conflicts regarding setting the cost of Booster Packs.

### Custom Sound Effects  
Enables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker, Explosher, On-beat, Off-beat, Pot, and Talking Flower.
